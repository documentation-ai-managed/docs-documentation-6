    Primary brand color: `#3B82F6`. Use it for headings and accents.
    
    | Color       | Hex Code   | Usage                  |
    |-------------|------------|------------------------|
    | Primary    | `#3B82F6` | Buttons, links        |
    | Secondary  | `#1E40AF` | Hover states          |
    | Neutral    | `#6B7280` | Text, borders         |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Typography" icon="font">
    Headings: Use H2 (`##`) for sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections.
    
    Body text: 16px base size. Avoid more than three font weights per page.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Icons" icon="image">
    Source from Lucide library. Examples: `book-open`, `code`, `shield`.
    
    Prefer line icons for scalability. Size: 24px default.

</Tabs>

<Expandable title="Advanced Customization" default-open="false">
  Customize your space with CSS variables. Set `--brand-primary: #3B82F6;` in theme settings.
  
  For custom components, extend MDX with React:

  ```tsx
  // components/CustomCallout.tsx
  import { Callout } from '@components/mdx';

  export const BrandCallout = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
    <Callout kind="info" style={{ borderLeftColor: '#3B82F6' }}>
      {children}
    </Callout>
  );
  ```
